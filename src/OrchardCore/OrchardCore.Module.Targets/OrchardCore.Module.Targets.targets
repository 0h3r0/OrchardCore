    This file is packaged with "OrchardCore.Module.Targets.nupkg" in "./build".
    It prevents VS from updating the project file e.g after copy / pasting an asset file.
    Note: Right now, doing the same in the related `.props` file doesn't work for razor files.
    It also includes in the VS project the 'Assets' files which are used by the gulp pipeline.
